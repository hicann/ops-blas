// SrotTilingData carries the runtime parameters for both code paths of aclblasSrot:
//   tilingKey == 0: contiguous path (SIMD membase), uses perCoreN/remainder/tileSize
//   tilingKey == 1: strided path (SIMT), uses incx/incy
// int32_t is required for incx/incy to carry negative strides.
//
// c/s pointer location: c and s may each independently be a host pointer or a
// device pointer (queried on the host via aclrtPointerGetAttributes). When a
// pointer is on the host, the host dereferences it once and forwards the scalar
// via cosValue/sinValue (scalar broadcast in the kernel). When a pointer is on
// the device, the host forwards the device pointer verbatim as a GM_ADDR to the
// kernel (no dereference, no D2H copy, no stream sync) and fills the scalar
// field with a 0.0f placeholder; the kernel then reads the value from GM.
// cIsDevice/sIsDevice select which source each path uses. The two are independent
// (c on host + s on device is legal), unlike rotg which requires all-or-nothing.

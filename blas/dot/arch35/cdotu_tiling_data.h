// Cdotu tiling data structure.
//
// The per-core workload partition (startIdx / calNum) is NOT stored here as arrays:
// it is recomputed inside the kernel from n / useCoreNum / blockIdx using the
// even-aligned partition (see cdotu_kernel.cpp), matching sdot/dotex which pass only
// useCoreNum plus strides and let each core derive its own [start, count). This keeps
// the tiling payload a fixed handful of scalars instead of a per-core 512-byte array,
// and removes the compile-time 64-core assumption (the core count is discovered at
// runtime via GetAivCoreCount).
//
// useDualAcc: enable the dual accumulator for n >= 3M (the two halves of each float4
// feed independent FMA chains), halving the serial dependency length - measured to keep
// float32 accumulation error within 1e-2 and run faster than a single accumulator; for
// n < 3M the single accumulator is optimal (no extra overhead).

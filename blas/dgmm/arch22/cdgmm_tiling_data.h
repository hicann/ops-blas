 * \brief Tiling data structure for aclblasCdgmm (arch22).
 *        Shared by host side and kernel side to avoid layout mismatch.
 *
 *        Row-major storage: A and C are m x n row-major complex matrices.
 *        Complex elements are stored as interleaved float pairs (real, imag).
 *        Only LEFT mode is implemented; RIGHT is rejected by the Host.

 * \brief Tiling data for Cdgmm.
 *
 * Row-split decomposition: each core handles a contiguous range of
 * rows [startRow[i], startRow[i] + rowCount[i]).  The Host balances
 * rows across at most CDGMM_MAX_CORES cores (capped by aivCoreNum and m).
 *
 * Matrices A and C are row-major.  lda/ldc are row strides (number of
 * complex elements between consecutive rows).  Complex elements are
 * stored as interleaved float pairs (real, imag).
